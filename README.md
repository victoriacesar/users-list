### Description

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>This project is a Users List app to display information quickly and dynamic. The data comes from a mock server, and the design of the app was followed through figma.<p>
<p>It was made for practice my skills in the front-end, the idea was to make a clean and basic app, but with very good and interesting code.</p>

<p>You can see the deployment here: <a href="https://users-list-mocha.vercel.app/">Users List deploy</a></p>

### More information

For this project I follow the conventional commit pattern, to use this pattern I used commitlint, husky and commitizen to have a nice and standardized commit tree.

<p>Features</p>
[x] Light and dark color mode;
[x] Filter data by text input;
[x] Sort data by columns and order by asceding or descending;
[x] Advanced filters and combine them as you want;

<p>Challenges</p>
[x] It was my first time using Material UI for design and components in a project;
[x] The component of the advance filters and the logic to add the filters as you click in the "Adicionar filtro" button;
[x] The logic to combine the advanced filters was very challenging, I think I spent a whole afternoon just in it.

### Technologies

The following technologies were used in this project:
